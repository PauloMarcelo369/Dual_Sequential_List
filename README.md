# Dual_Sequential_List
creation of a sequential list that reproduces the quick insert property of a linked list in O(1). The list always tries to leave the elements in the middle so that adjacent positions are free. Thus causing operations such as pop and push to be done on O(1). The problem is that, necessarily, the elements have to be in the middle. Therefore, shift operations to meet this need make the code less efficient.
